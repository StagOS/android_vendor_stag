    This file contains permissions to be granted by default. Default
    permissions are granted to special platform components and to apps
    that are approved to get default grants. The special components
    are apps that are expected tto work out-of-the-box as they provide
    core use cases such as default dialer, default email, etc. These
    grants are managed by the platform. The apps that are additionally
    approved for default grants are ones that provide carrier specific
    functionality, ones legally required at some location, ones providing
    alternative disclosure and opt-out UI, ones providing highlight features
    of a dedicated device, etc.
